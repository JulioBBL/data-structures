# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository was created after I found myself in the need of data structure knowledge for my graduation class. It helped me practing what I already knew and even learning different aspects of all the programming languages I am most excited for.

## Contribution

I mainly push code here for later reference, but you can also fork and create pull requests for anything you deem worthy of. Any feedback is much appreciated. You can find me [here](https://twitter.com/darqueos) (DMs are open).

## Playground

You should be able to run any file directly from the command line. Follow the instructions for each programming language below.

- Python

> The entry language to most Computer Sciences courses, I find Python to be the most readable language. I value it for its relevance in data science and machine learning.

At the time of writing, `3.6.2` was the latest version. Although other versions may be compatible, you're better suited installing this one.

```bash
$ python -V
Python 3.6.2
```

Run any Python file with the command:

```bash
$ python <file>.py
```

- JavaScript
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Go
